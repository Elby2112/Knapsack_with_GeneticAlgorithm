# Genetic Algorithm for Knapsack Problem ðŸ§¬ðŸŽ’

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm in Python to solve the classical Knapsack Problem, demonstrating the application of genetic algorithms in optimization challenges.

## Overview

The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to select a subset of items with maximum total value without exceeding a given capacity. This implementation uses a genetic algorithm to find an optimal solution.

## Features

- **Knapsack Class:** Implementation of the Knapsack class with methods for evaluating fitness.
- **Genetic Algorithm:** Utilization of a genetic algorithm to evolve solutions over multiple generations.
- **Code in Python:** The entire implementation is written in Python for clarity and ease of understanding.
